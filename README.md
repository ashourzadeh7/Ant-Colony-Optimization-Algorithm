# Ant-Colony-Optimization-Algorithm
# A meta-heuristic method for solving combinatorial optimization problems

Ant colony optimization (ACO) is a population-based metaheuristic algorithm that can be used to find approximate solutions to difficult optimization problems.

The ant colony algorithm is inspired by studies and observations on ant colonies. These studies have shown that ants are social insects that live in colonies and their
behavior is more for the survival of the colony than for the survival of a part of it. One of the most important and interesting behavior of ants is their behavior to
find food, especially how to find the shortest path between food sources and nest. This type of behavior of ants has a type of crowd intelligence that has recently been
noticed by scientists. In the real world, ants first go here and there randomly to find food. Then they return to the nest and leave a trail of pheromone. Such traces
turn white after rain and can be seen. When other ants find this path, they sometimes stop roaming and follow it. Then, if they get food, they return home and leave
another footprint next to the previous one. And in other words, they strengthen the previous path. 

# The goal of the algorithm: 
The goal of the ants algorithm is to imitate this behavior by artificial ants that are moving on the image below. The problem is to find the
shortest path, so the optimal path is the goal.

# Algorithm application: 
One of the applications of this algorithm is to reach the optimal solution in the periodic salesman problem, so that various types of ant algorithm are prepared to solve this problem, because this numerical method is better than analytical and genetic methods in cases with a continuous time variable. It has one advantage; And that is that it is an algorithm with the ability to repeat, and therefore, with the passage of time, it can change the answer live; This feature is important in the routing of computer networks and urban transportation system.
